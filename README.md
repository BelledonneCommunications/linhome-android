Linhome is an open source software designed to communicate via voice and video with door entry devices.
The Linhome application has been developed to meet the emerging needs of intercom and video monitoring system developers to leverage a robust, secure and interoperable open source VoIP solution to build their own mobile application.

# Building the app

If you have Android Studio, simply open the project, wait for the gradle synchronization and then build/install the app.
It will download the linphone library from our Maven repository as an AAR file so you don't have to build anything yourself.

If you don't have Android Studio, you can build and install the app using gradle:
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
will compile the APK file (assembleRelease to instead if you want to build a release package), and then
```
./gradlew installDebug
```
to install the generated APK in the previous step (use installRelease instead if you built a release package).

APK files are stored within ```./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/``` and ```./app/build/outputs/apk/release/``` directories.

## Building a local SDK

1. Clone the linphone-sdk repository from out gitlab:
```
git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-sdk.git --recursive
```

2. Follow the instructions in the linphone-sdk/README file to build the SDK.

3. Create or edit the gradle.properties file in $GRADLE_USER_HOME (usually ~/.gradle) file and add the absolute path to your linphone-sdk build directory, for example:
```
LinphoneSdkBuildDir=/home/<username>/linphone-sdk/build/
```

4. Rebuild the app in Android Studio.

## Native debugging

1. Install LLDB from SDK Tools in Android-studio.

2. In Android-studio go to Run->Edit Configurations->Debugger.

3. Select 'Dual' or 'Native' and add the path to linphone-sdk debug libraries (build/libs-debug/ for example).

4. Open native file and put your breakpoint on it.

5. Make sure you are using the debug AAR in the app/build.gradle script and not the release one (to have faster builds by default the release AAR is used even for debug APK flavor).

6. Debug app.

## Troubleshouting

If you encounter the `couldn't find "libc++_shared.so"` crash when the app starts, simply clean the project in Android Studio (under Build menu) and build again.

When submitting an issue, please attach the matching library logs. To enable them, go to Settings -> Enable debug logs.

Then restart the app, reproduce the issue and upload the logs using the "Send Log file" button on the About page in Settings Page.

## Create an APK with a different package name

Simply edit the app/build.gradle file and change the value returned by method ```getPackageName()```
The next build will automatically use this value everywhere thanks to ```manifestPlaceholders``` feature of gradle and Android.

You may have already noticed that the app installed by Android Studio has ```org.linhome.debug``` package name.
If you build the app as release, the package name will be ```org.linhome```.

## Firebase push notifications

Now that Google Cloud Messaging has been deprecated and will be completely removed on April 11th 2019, the only official way of using push notifications is through Firebase.

However to make Firebase push notifications work, the project needs to have a file named app/google-services.json that contains some confidential informations, so you won't find it (it has been added to the .gitignore file).
This means that if you compile this project, you won't have push notification feature working in the app!

To enable them, just add your own ```google-services.json``` in the app folder.
